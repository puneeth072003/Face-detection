## **Project Mask-recognition**
 Its a simple project in which using **Haar-cascade frontal face detection** algorithm, the face is recoginzed and marked in the given video uploaded or captured via web cam and tells whether the person is wearing mask or not.

 ## **Prequisites**

- Firstly download any **IDE** to run the code.
- Download [**Pre-trained model**](/Prerequisite/Model.h5) and [**haarcascade_frontalface.xml**](/Prerequisite/haarcascade_frontalface.xml) both files from **Prerequsite folder** in the repository to your the local machine.
- Download all the modules required to run the code which are mentioned below.
    - **Tensorflow** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install tensorflow
        ```
        
    - **Numpy** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install numpy
        ```
    - **Cv2** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install cv2
        ```
    - **Keras** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install keras
        ```
- Copy the **Source code** from the above src folder and run in it in the IDE.
- There you have it a working project in your local desktop.
- Feel free to Experiment with the Source Code and find what works best for you.

**NOTE:** You can also use a ***Video*** and get the result insted of ***Web-cam***, but relying on ***Web-Cam*** method is recommended because you should have to follow additional steps which include changing the path of the video to be processed to make it working.
