 ## **Prequisites**

- Firstly download any **IDE** to run the code.
- Download [**Pre-trained model**](/Prerequisite/Model.h5) available on the internet and [**haarcascade_frontalface.xml**](/Prerequisite/haarcascade_frontalface.xml) files from above folder in the repository to your the local desktop.
- Download all the modules required to run the code which are mentioned below.
    - **Tensorflow** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install tensorflow
        ```
        
    - **Numpy** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install numpy
        ```
    - **Cv2** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install cv2
        ```
    - **Keras** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install keras
        ```
- Copy the **Source code** from the above src folder and run in it in the IDE.
- There you have it a working project in your local desktop.
- Feel free to Experiment with the Source Code and find what works best for you.
