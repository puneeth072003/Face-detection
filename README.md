# **Mask-recognition**
 Its a simple project in which using Haar-cascade frontal face detection algorithm, the face is recoginzed and marked in the given video uploaded or captured via web cam and tells whether the person is wearing mask or not.
 
 ## **Prequisites**
***
- Firstly download any **IDE** to run the code.
- Download **Pre-trained model** and **haarcascade_frontalface.xml** files from above folders in the repository to your the local desktop.
- Download all the modules required to run the code which are mentioned below.
    - **Tensorflow** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install tensorflow
        ```
        
    - **Numpy** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install numpy
        ```
    - **Cv2** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install cv2
        ```
    - **Keras** *which can be downloded by running below command in the terminal.*
        ```python 
            pip install keras
        ```
